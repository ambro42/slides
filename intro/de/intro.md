- Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know.
- Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world ~Cypherpunk Manifesto

# What is 'Crypto'?

Cryptography is:

- A bunch of complicated mathematics
- The basis for many security mechanisms
- A core functionality of Internet

Cryptography is not:

- The solution to all security problems
- Reliable unless implemented and used properly
- Something you should try to invent yourself

# What is a Party?
- A venue to have fun.
- Nice people and friends (hint: bring your friends).
- Music.
- Drinks & snacks.

# Crypto + Party = Cryptoparty

# Why do we need cryptography?
- To answer basic security needs
- Confidentiality and Privacy protection
- Anonymity
- Authentication
- Integrity

# Privacy
- Having control over one’s personal information or actions 
- Technical privacy invasion
- Cookies, CCTV, Metadata, Social Networks, Search engines, ISP, fidelity programs etc.
- Moral privacy invasion
- "If you aren't doing anything wrong, what do you have to hide?“
- Cryptography provides part of the answer
- Secure communications
- Disk encryption

# Security vs Privacy

# Anonymity

- Being unidentifiable in one’s actions
- Complete anonymity (difficult)
- The real author is not traceable
- Pseudonymity (not as difficult)
- Possible to link an author under a pseudonym
- Cryptography provides part of the answer
- Onion routing
- Bitcoins

# Authentication
- Continuity of relationship, knowing who to trust and who not to trust.
- Where is the authentication across digital network?
- Cryptography provides part of the answer
- Public-key cryptography
- SSH, TLS
- Trust Agility
- Doesn’t scale really well

# Integrity
- Integrity has to do with the validity of the data
- Desktop publishing is cheap and easy
- It is simple to modify and falsify data
- How do we verify the integrity of what we see online?
- Cryptography can provide an answer
- Hash functions

# Why Cryptoparty?
- There is real need of awareness about:
- Cryptography
- Security tools
- Privacy protection
- Hands-on workshops
- Emails, Web traffic, IM, Disk Encryption, Anonymity tools, NAME it Do it.
- Legal awareness
- Evolutions of privacy laws in different countries
- Lightning talks
- Share your knowledge
